# Synthesis-of-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-by-precipitation-method-and-identification-and-characterization

**OBJECTIVE**
In this work, I developed a simple but effective technique to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles using zinc nitrate and potassium hydroxide in aqueous solution. The precipitated compound was calcined and the zinc oxide nanoparticle was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction technique. Most importantly, synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticle using precipitation method has been chosen because it finds a wide application in biomedical areas, industrial fields and other technical products as well like it finds a very major place in rubber industry. It is mandatory to provide cheaper and easier treatment methods so that every human being can afford it and also from protection of skin and various fungal problems to treatment of cancer, zinc oxide finds a place in many biomedical applications. With the simple experimental set-up with minimum components and less time, we have synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticle. Zinc nitrate is used as the precursor (initial reagent) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used as the precipitating agent to synthesis zinc oxide nanoparticles. Research in the field of synthesis methodology of nanomaterials mainly focuses on controlling their shape, size and composition. Each of these factors is a key factor in determining the properties of materials that lead to different technological applications. This technique has many advantages such as it is more controllable, reproducible and the size of particle obtained can be controlled easily, it does not need any catalysts, space required is less and it creates no pollution and is quite cost effective.

**METHOD**

Apparatus needed: Simple apparatus like test tubes, beakers, a stirrer, weighing machine, a centrifuge, falcon tube and a muffle oven for calcination was 
used in this synthesis process.

STEP 1: Zinc oxide nanoparticles was synthesized by direct precipitation method using zinc nitrate (ZnNO3) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as precursors. In this work, the aqueous 
solution of Zinc Nitrate and the solution of KOH was prepared with deionized water.

STEP 2: The zinc nitrate solution prepared was vigorously stirred and the KOH solution was slowly added to the solution of zinc nitrate and after a rest of short time, a white 
suspension was formed.

STEP 3: The white product was divided into two samples and kept in the falcon tube.

STEP 4: Centrifuge samples at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes each and also wash them 3x times with distilled water and then finally clean them with absolute alcohol (ethanol). 

NOTE: The centrifugation was done to remove the water from the white product (suspension) so formed so that the powder can be extracted out of it.

STEP 5: Then two samples so obtained was calcined for 3 hours and for 5 hours (keeping thE temperature constant, i.e. 180°C). 

STEP 6: After the calcination was done, white powder of zinc oxide nanoparticle formed which was characterized by X-Ray Diffraction method.

**X-RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS**

In XRD technique, a scattering of X-rays by the atoms of a crystal is done that produces an interference effect so that the diffraction pattern gives information on the structure of the crystal or the identity of a crystalline substance.

**RESULTS**

To calculate the size of the particle formed, we have used Scherrer’s equation which is given by the formula

where, 
τ is the mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains.
K is a dimensionless shape factor, with a value close to unity. The shape factor has a typical value of about 0.9, but varies with the actual shape of the crystallite; 
λ is the X-ray wavelength; 
β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), after subtracting the instrumental line broadening, in radians. This quantity is also sometimes denoted as ∆(2θ); 
θ is the Bragg angle.

**CONCLUSION**

After applying Scherrer’s equation, we found out that the particle size of the zinc oxide nanoparticle increased with increase in time in which it was calcined. We infer that the results are verified practically from the graph of XRD analysis and theoretically from Scherrer’s equation. Hence, in this study the zinc oxide nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by direct precipitation method using zinc nitrate as zinc source and KOH as precipitating agent in aqueous solution and finally zinc oxide nanoparticles were characterized by XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) analysis. The potential advances for non-medicinal applications even surpass that of the current medicinal uses. Zinc Oxide Nanorod Sensors, Spintronics, and Piezoelectricity are all very promising fields and ones to keep an eye on in the not too distant future. Zinc is an indispensable inorganic element universally used in medicine, biology and in industrial sectors. It is an essential constituent in bones, teeth, functional proteins and many useful enzymes. As zinc oxide nanoparticles are used in various spheres of science, it proves that it is an indispensable substance which has proved to be equally important to man as well as animals. But just as a coin has two sides, it has also some demerits. Long time exposure of the nanoparticles with higher concentration can be harmful to the living system.

**SOME MORE PROPERTIES OF ZINC OXIDE NANOPARTICLE**

1. It should be non-toxic. 
2. It should not react with food or container. 
3. It should be of good taste or tasteless. 
4. It should not have disagreeable smell.
5. They have wide band gap energy.
